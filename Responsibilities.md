This file describes the responsibilities of each role involved in putting on
the monthly Digital Privacy Workshop. The format of the Digital Privacy Workshop
is also described, since it's a decent template for a hands-on training. This
should be all the info you would need to organize and host your own Digital
Privacy Workshop!


## Roles
To help ensure trainers are available, it's best for whoever is handling
each role to also attend the workshop itself.

#### MC/Booking
The MC is responsible for booking & interacting with the venue, as well as
hosting the event and keeping things running smoothly. For example, this means
making sure the location is reserved, that fellow organizers know where to go,
that things stay on track during the workshop, and that things are overall going
well.

#### Marketing
The marketer is in charge of all communication & marketing for the event, so
that fellow members and the public know about it. This includes flyer design/distribution, email
reminders, social media, outreach, and knowing what to say for all of those.

#### Volunteer/Trainer
A volunteer (aka: angel, trainer, ...) is in charge of running individual workgroups
at a workshop, directly interacting with attendees, giving advice and instruction.
This requires at least some level experience (but less than you'd think!) in different
tech areas, and some experience tutoring or explaining things. This is the easiest
role to take on, and multiple are needed for every workshop.


## Responsibilities

What precisely does each role have to do to put on a Digital Privacy Workshop?

#### MC/Booking
1. Secure the venue (deadline: 1 month before event, ideally)
	1. Identify an appropriate venue
		* Mandatory:
			* Wifi with internet access, tables, accessible by the public
		* Nice to have:
			* neutral: no alcohol/smoking, minimal 'cultural' baggage (eg: university spaces vs. other public spaces).
			* power outlets, whiteboard, flexible timing.
			* Not too noisy to train, but also can tolerate the noise of conversations.
	1. Book/reserve the venue
		* Is there a reservation fee? A form that needs to be filled out?
	1. Spread info on the location/date/time to other organizers & members.
		* Date, Time, Location, any venue-specific considerations (alcohol on-site, is/is not accessible)
1. Play the host
	1. Open the venue
	1. Welcome attendees as they arrive (doors)
		* People know they're at cryptoparty, and to socialize before the event starts
	1. Run the news/discussion opening portion
		* Analyze/critique current events as teachable moments regarding privacy, computer security, etc.
	1. Poll the audience/volunteers to determine what workgroups to split into
		* Are there any requests? What concerns do attendees have?
		* Are there volunteers available to run a workgroup for a given topic?
		* Take a show of hands, see what exactly people want!
	1. When finished, close up the venue
1. Keep things on schedule
	* Based on the decided schedule, keep things running! Nothing's demoralizing
		quite like an event that veers off-track, floating totally directionless.
1. If necessary, run a workgroup as a trainer

#### Marketing
1. Verify the event details
	* Time, Date, Location, and venue-specific concerns (accessible, parking, alcohol on-site, ...)
1. Edit/create event-specific assets
	* Update time/date/location for flyers & handouts
	* Order more stickers if we need them
1. Schedule tweets for twitter account using tweetdeck
	* 3+ tweets spread over the week or two before the event at various times.
	* The more the better, right?
1. Create Facebook event page, invite attendees (if we do have a Faceobok)
1. Make other social media posts (reddit? whatever else we have)
1. Go Flyering!
	* Print off a few flyers, tape them up on streetpoles, in cafes, libaries, ...
	* Corralling some volunteers to help you is recommended
1. Outreach to potentially interested parties & audiences
	* All your friends! Activist groups, meetup groups, volunteer organizations, ... Get imaginitive! Who needs privacy most?
	* Having specific info to point them to is useful. Stickers, website url, event information, handouts, ...
1. Send email reminder to mailing list
	* All relevant event details, referencing current sing-ups for organizers/volunteers, and if there's a need for more trainers or not.
1. Attend as a volunteer! :)
	* Especially if you recommended cryptoparty to anyone face-to-face.

#### Volunteer/Trainer

## Workshop Format
The primary goal of the workshop is hands-on, effective training on subjects
that attendees most care about. Lectures aren't nearly as helpful as hands-on
training, and there's no point training on a technology that doesn't actually
address an attendee's concerns. This format attempts to best deliver that,
and of course is subject to change. If you think there's a useful change, bring
it up with other members and see what they think!

1. Event Starts!
1. ~30 minutes of socializing
	* People can socialize, arrive late, etc.
1. ~15 minutes of current events
	* critique & analyze current events to teach privacy principles, etc.
1. Gauge demands for workgroups, and ability to host them (recommended 3 or 4 at most)
	1. Is anyone left behind by english-only? Likely not for our area...
	1. What concerns do attendees have? What technologies do they actually want to learn?
		* Take a show of hands!
	1. How many trainers are available? Can they teach on the desired technologies?
1. Split into workgroups
	* This is where the education happens! Yay :D
